# Frogger-Clone
A re-creation of Frogger I made to start learning Game Dev. 
The build in the repo is for **Windows (64-Bit)** Devices.

**Info:** 
- This is a clone of Frogger I made with a Unity Tutorial. 

- It has a single level, obstacles, lives, score, and a timer 

- All Rights to the original Frogger are reserved to their respective owners

- Get to the homes at the end to advance to start the level over

- Go for a high score!

**Controls** 
- Arrow Keys / WASD: Hop 

**Note:**
- If possible, please open this Program in Windowed Mode on your device. The tutorial did not show me how to make an exit button.
